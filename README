1. How to Compile

Platform: Windows
Prerequisite libraries: iconv, libxml2, opencv 2.3+

a. Install all the dependencies specified above.
b. Put this source code in your local directory.
c. Use CMake to generate a project file or a make file. You may need to input the paths for the required libraries.
d. Build the generated project file.

Although the code has only been tested on Windows, it should be easy to be adapted for Linux. The only flatform dependent module is the 'dataReader', where the 'ImageDataReader' reads the list of file names contained in the specified directory. 


2. How to Use

USAGE:

a.
Hierarchy_Ensemble <path_of_sequence> <is_image> 
b.
Hierarchy_Ensemble <path_of_sequence> <is_image> <detection_file>

<path_of_seuqence>: the path of the directory containing images or the path of the video
<is_image>: '1' for image format sequence, '0' the video format sequence
<detection_file>: the xml detection file, whose structure should follow the example in the supplementary files

When <detection_file> is not specified, the program will use the HOG detector to detect pedestrians online; Otherwise, the xml file specified will be read to get the detection results in it. For the exact structure of the detection file, see the example files in the supplementary files.

Before running the program, you may need to change the parameters stored in 'config.txt'. There are detailed explanations and recommended values in it.


EXAMPLE:

a.
Hierarchy_Ensemble C:/video_data/TownCentreXVID.avi 0
(The program will use the OpenCV's HOG detector)
b.
Hierarchy_Ensemble C:/video_data/PETS09S2L1/ 1 PETS09_S2L1_det_opencv.xml
(The program will read the images stored in the directory and use the detection xml file as the source of detections)


NOTE:

(*) When the program is running, type 'p' to pause and 'q' to quit.
(**) The tracking result will be recorded in a file named "output.xml".
